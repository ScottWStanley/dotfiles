Seraphina,

This is quite a surprise to me. I'm VERY grateful to you and Geraldine for making this decision.

However, I also feel partly responsible for this. When I delegated the task of food organization, it didn't occur to me to outline a budget (a bad habit of mine is to see everyone else's world from my own perspective), and was shocked at the grocery bill. I promise that for Pioneer Farm, I'll run a very tight ship.

Before I contact the parents about filling out a reimbursement form, Sanae feels it's important for you to see a breakdown of expenses at this time, so I'm turning the reigns over to her. Expect to see an email from her shortly.

Thank you again for this.

With much gratitude,
Scott

Having asked parents to purchase food for this trip was clearly a departure from our current practices to fund field trips entirely out of tuition, as we do state clearly in our tuition contract that parents will not incur any additional charges other than those related to our strings program. For a variety of reasons, we did not include the cost for the food expense associated with this field trip in the class budget, which led to parents being asked to provide funding for the food. In retrospect, this should have been handled differently, and I'm so very sorry for any confusion or financial strain this may have caused you and the Grade 3 class parents.

This additional expense does not mean that the budget of the class will be reduced, but simply means that the funds will be located elsewhere. Parents are of course very welcome to make a tax deductible donation to the school if they would like to donate the amount they spent on the trip. They can simply add that amount to the annual fund contribution they were already planning on donating. If the class parents who made the purchases wish to be reimbursed, they will simply need to fill out a reimbursement form, with the receipts attached, and submit it to the office.

Again, I apologize for any confusion that has surrounded the organization of this particular trip and am grateful to be able to benefit from your experience this year to ensure a smoother process for classes to come. Thank you for your support of the school on many levels, and for carrying the Grade 3 class.

Based on yesterday's conversation, the most likely way to repay those individuals is to have every parent write a check to me, and then redistribute the money accordingly. While this seems quite natural, I contacted you yesterday just to be sure there wasn't a different protocol reccommended by the school.
