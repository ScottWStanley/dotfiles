Hi Mary,
I hope your Sunday is going well :)

I'm going to send the email below to the office, but would like you to review it to make sure I don't say anything out of line (ultimately being YOUR representative to the class).

Please feel free to make any edits you think should happen and send back to me.

Thanks.

Dear Third Grade Parents,
Thank you to those who have dropped off your checks. We've repaid two of the three parents, and partially paid the third.

We need 6 more checks; it would be great if we could get these by the end of this week. Please do what you can to make this happen.

At this time I'd also like to acknowledge that it's not typical for there to be a "charge" associated with field trips at Three Cedars. It would have been much better for the class to come together as a community to contribute materials or time, rather than a few people making decisions for the whole class and then shouldering that load. However, outside issues made planning very difficult to achieve this kind of coordination. 

The planning for the May trip to Pioneer Farm will be much more gratifying for ALL parents, and you will not be asked for any payment. I've got a pretty thick skin, so you're all certainly welcome to give any feedback you have to make Pioneer more enjoyable for you.

-Scott
