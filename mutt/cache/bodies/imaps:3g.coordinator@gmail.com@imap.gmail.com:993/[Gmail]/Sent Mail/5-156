Hi Mary,

There is another thing you need to do for the field trip.
All of the chaperones are required to file these paper work.


1. Fingerprint (Turnaround time is about three weeks)

2. Background Check (Turnaround time is about one weeks)

3. Copy of Driver's License

4. Proof of Driver's Insurance Liability Limits, which must specify:

   - minimum Bodily Injury Liability limit of $100,000 for each person
   injured
   - up to a total of $300,000 per accident
   - or a combined single liability limit of at least $300,000

(this is per page 51 of the Community Handbook)



At this point, you won't have enough time to do 1 and 2.
Please go to the school office on Monday with your Driver's License and
Proof of Liability Limits and tell them that you are going to go to
Sunfield.

Thank you.

Scott and Sanae Stanley
