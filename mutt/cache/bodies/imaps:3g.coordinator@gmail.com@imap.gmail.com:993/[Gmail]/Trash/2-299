I've spoken with Mary about recovering the money spent by a few of you from the parent body at Parent Evening this Tuesday, and she is agreeable to the following idea.

I'll write up an email to send to all parents, partly to remind them about Parent Night, but also to inform them to bring their checkbooks and be prepared to write a check for X dollars, where X is the amount spent on food and other communal items divided by non-chaperone parents.

To help this along, like Rachel indicated in her email, please list the amount you spent on communal items and what the item was (in broad categories, don't go into great detail).

In my email I'll be requesting parents to acknowledge
