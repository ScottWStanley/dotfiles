Hi Corey,

We haven't heard from anyone about shopping. Have you?
We are sorry we cannot go there either but since we are going to Lisa's to
make chili tomorrow,
we can come to your house pick up the stuff that need for chili.
If it makes sense to you, we can ask Tabatha to buy apples and cut them too.

What do  you think?


-Sanae
