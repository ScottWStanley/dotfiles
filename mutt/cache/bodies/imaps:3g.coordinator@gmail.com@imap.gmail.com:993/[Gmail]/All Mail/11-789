Thank you.

Let's say we need:
  3 knives/cutting boards for children to chop with
  2 spatulas/skillets for scrambled eggs
  2 pans or pots for boiling water

I'll see what Sanae wants to contribute to this tonight. I don't have Lisa's list in front of me, can you think of any other cooking needs based on what we're having?
