Hi Sanae and Scott,

Thank you for the final list; I find it very helpful.  You may want to
put an email out to remind parents to bring the storage case (labeled)
for the special items kids need:  storage case for retainer (don't
know if anyone has this yet), eyeglass case for glasses when not worn.
 It seems pretty obvious for the category of "toiletries", but Gregory
has been wearing glasses forever, and it just occurred to me to bring
an eyeglass case (labeled brightly colored, so it's easily seen in a
dimly lit tent) for when he's asleep.  He's supposed to wear glasses
all the time while awake, but often "forgets" to put them on and they
could be overlooked.

Lydia
