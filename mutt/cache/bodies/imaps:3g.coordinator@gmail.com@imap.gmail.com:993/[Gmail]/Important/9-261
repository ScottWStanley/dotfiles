Subject: Sunfield reimbursement

Lisa=2C Corey=2C and Rachel=2C
Sanae has totaled the trip expenses based on the receipts you all submitted=
=2C and subtracted $100 which the school will be contributing.

As such=2C each family's share comes to $54.00=2C which I'll be requesting =
on Wednesday. It would be sooner=2C but I need to talk to Seraphina about a=
 couple of protocol questions I have first.

We just wanted you all to know your money is on its way.
