Hi Seraphina,
As a follow-up to yesterday's conversation and for Geraldine's visibility, following is a summary about what I'd like to know.

Nearly $1000 was spent on this trip by a few individuals, on:
- Thursday communal meal and snacks
- Firewood
- First aid supplies
- Transportation
- Miscellaneous (tarps, minor cookware, etc.)

We are aware that the school has budgeted only $100 toward transportation costs, and the plan is to divide the remaining balance between the parents evenly (roughly $900/17).

My main question is one of routing the money. Based on yesterday's conversation, the most likely way to repay those individuals is to have every parent write a check to me, and then redistribute the money accordingly. While this seems quite natural, I contacted you yesterday just to be sure there wasn't a different protocol reccommended by the school.

Before I go ahead, if you and Geraldine would confirm my thoughts I would appreciate it. Thank you for your help.

-Scott Stanley
