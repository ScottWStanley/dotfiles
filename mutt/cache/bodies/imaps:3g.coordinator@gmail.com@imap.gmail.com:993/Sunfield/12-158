Dear Scott,



Thank you for your email.



This trip is relatively new for our school, and it is evident that we have =
not yet mastered the details of this overnight. Having asked parents to pur=
chase food for this trip was clearly a departure from our current practices=
 to fund field trips entirely out of tuition, as we do state clearly in our=
 tuition contract that parents will not incur any additional charges other =
than those related to our strings program. For a variety of reasons, we did=
 not include the cost for the food expense associated with this field trip =
in the class budget, which led to parents being asked to provide funding fo=
r the food. In retrospect, this should have been handled differently, and I=
'm so very sorry for any confusion or financial strain this may have caused=
 you and the Grade 3 class parents.



In this light, we feel it is the responsibility of the school to reimburse =
parents fully for the unplanned expenses they incurred related to food for =
this trip. This additional expense does not mean that the budget of the cla=
ss will be reduced, but simply means that the funds will be located elsewhe=
re. Parents are of course very welcome to make a tax deductible donation to=
 the school if they would like to donate the amount they spent on the trip.=
 They can simply add that amount to the annual fund contribution they were =
already planning on donating. If the class parents who made the purchases w=
ish to be reimbursed, they will simply need to fill out a reimbursement for=
m, with the receipts attached, and submit it to the office.



I hope this helps clarify, but please let me know if you have additional qu=
estions. Again, I apologize for any confusion that has surrounded the organ=
ization of this particular trip and am grateful to be able to benefit from =
your experience this year to ensure a smoother process for classes to come.=
 Thank you for your support of the school on many levels, and for carrying =
the Grade 3 class.



Warmly,

Seraphina

Hi Seraphina,

As a follow-up to yesterday's conversation and for Geraldine's visibility, =
following is a summary about what I'd like to know.



Nearly $1000 was spent on this trip by a few individuals, on:

- Thursday communal meal and snacks

- Firewood

- First aid supplies

- Transportation

- Miscellaneous (tarps, minor cookware, etc.)



We are aware that the school has budgeted only $100 toward transportation c=
osts, and the plan is to divide the remaining balance between the parents e=
venly (roughly $900/17).



My main question is one of routing the money. Based on yesterday's conversa=
tion, the most likely way to repay those individuals is to have every paren=
t write a check to me, and then redistribute the money accordingly. While t=
his seems quite natural, I contacted you yesterday just to be sure there wa=
sn't a different protocol reccommended by the school.



Before I go ahead, if you and Geraldine would confirm my thoughts I would a=
ppreciate it. Thank you for your help.



-Scott Stanley
