Hi Scott and Sanae,

I am packing two sleeping bag liners in the event of bedwetting; I've =
already inserted one into his sleeping bag (and had him try it out), and =
have left it there so it's ready to sleep in.  It doesn't fasten to the =
sleeping bag, but rather is just inserted.  One side is the bottom that =
goes underneath him and the other, thinner side is the top.  I will =
include a plastic bag to put one into in the event of bedwetting.  There =
will also be extra set of PJs and underwear for him.

Thank you,
Lydia=
