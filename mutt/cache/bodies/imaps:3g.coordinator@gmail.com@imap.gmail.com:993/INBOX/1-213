Bless Sanae's heart for thinking of me.  Thank you for agreeing with her :)=
=0A=
=0A=
Unfortunately, I just talked to Corey over the phone and said I'd try to at=
tend the debriefing meeting.  Then, I saw all of the e-mails about meeting =
including your thoughtful one, and wished I had bowed out.  =0A=
=0A=
I wasn't thinking of all the ramifications when I spoke with her.  I had ac=
tually called her to ask a totally unrelated question and then she sprang t=
he meeting on me at the end there.  I was NOT thinking clearly when I respo=
nded.  =0A=
=0A=
Do you have the energy for this meeting so soon? Honestly, I feel like the =
chaperones were all overtaxed and should not be meeting so soon after.  But=
, I realize that time is of the essence with reviewing.=0A=
=0A=
Yes, I am most definitely spread too thin (this is compounded by the fact t=
hat my husband is in NYC until October 19 for work so I am also a single mo=
m for two weeks), but if this meeting can happen tomorrow I will be there f=
or part of it.  I think I can refuel before our parent evening on Tuesday. =
 If it's happening on Tuesday afternoon, I will not be attending more than =
45 minutes.=0A=
=0A=
I want to do right by the class, but, I also have to acknowledge that I'm n=
ot super woman and that I'm pretty much my child's only parent for now.  I =
am kicking myself for not saying no from the start.  It's fine.  Will be mo=
re clear headed next time.=0A=
=0A=
Cheers and thanks, =0A=

Mary,=0A=
Sanae is concerned that you're spread too thin for a meeting this week, and=
 I agree (I should have though about this before typing my last email).=0A=
=0A=
You shouldn't be troubled with anything regarding future trip planning; tha=
t's something best discussed with future chaperones (which I suspect will b=
e most of us again).=0A=
=0A=
Regarding Sunfield, I'm sure like the rest of us, you have plenty of feedba=
ck about our experience, but you'll be passing that along to either Geraldi=
ne or the Sunfield directors. It would be simple enough for the rest of us =
to collect our thoughts and pass them along to you to integrate with your f=
eedback.=0A=

Please feel free to sit this one out so you can take care of your family's =
