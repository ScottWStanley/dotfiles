Hello Mary,=0A=
Would you please give my notes a quick sanity-check before I send them out =
to the parents?=0A=
=0A=
I hope you and Ari are doing fine.=0A=

Thanks in advance.=0A=

Third Grade Parents,=0A=
Following are notes on what Mary discussed during our last Parent Night (Oc=
t. 8).=0A=
=0A=
Music and Movement=0A=
The children are learning the "grammar" of music. Like a foreign language, =
they'll be more able to create tunes on their own more readily in this way.=
=0A=
=0A=
In addition to some of the more obvious benefits of learning music, there i=
s another way it serves the children. Music, as well as movement, are ways =
for a child to develop a simultaneous sense of self and group, by requiring=
 one to keep to one's own actions (tempo) and yet be harmonious with the su=
rrounding actions.=0A=
=0A=
Sunfield Photos=0A=
Corey kindly brought a CD loaded with photos from the Sunfield trip to shar=
e with all of us. I currently have it and will be distributing the data onc=
e I have a secure way of doing so (sorry, I've been a bit slow about this).=
 Expect to see an email this week about how to get the data.=0A=
=0A=
Third Grade Readiness=0A=
The parents were given a "Third Grade Readiness" checklist for our referenc=
e. This does not need to be filled out, but is a reference to understand ro=
ughly where the third grade child should be developmentally some time this =
year. Many items will be covered in class, so don't worry if, for example, =
your child isn't super proficient with telling time. The class is learning =
about telling time this month and will learn about money in the spring.=0A=
=0A=
Sharing about your child=0A=
Throughout the year, parents will be given the opportunity to speak about t=
heir child in a way that allows us to better empathize with that child. Thi=
s is another aspect of Mary's overarching effort to build a stronger class =
community.=0A=
=0A=
Parent-teacher conferences=0A=
Parent-teacher conferences will be coming soon. If you have any particular =
topics or concerns you would like to discuss with Mary at your conference, =
please let her know soon through e-mail: mspurgin@threecedarswaldorf.org so=
 she can give some thought to the issue.=0A=
=0A=
Miscellaneous=0A=
By now children should know their own address and phone number. If your chi=
ld doesn't, please work on this with him/her.=0A=
=0A=
Enjoy your week!=0A=
