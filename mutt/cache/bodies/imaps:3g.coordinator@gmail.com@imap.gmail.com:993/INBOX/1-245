Hi Danny,
Thanks a lot for volunteering. I think helping up out with planning for
Pioneer Farms (in May I think) would be hugely helpful. We haven't started
as we're still catching our breath, but I figure if we jump on it in a month
or so we can avoid anyone getting overworked (months to plan rather than 3
weeks). It should fit your schedule pretty well.

Does that sound good to you?

-Scott
