Dear Chaperones,

Thank you for all of your hard work and time!

I hope by now that you have seen my letter about the farm trip.  As of now,=
 I have spoken with Lydia and Mary.  Mary is coming as a chaperone. We are =
way over the limit, but Maryanne says as long as the extra adults are not i=
nvolved in the activities (but maybe involved in cooking and other things i=
nstead), then the adult crowding will not be an issue.

Unfortunately, Joseph Mantis will not join us on the trip because he is in =
his aunt's wedding.  However, Joseph lives on a farm and does farm chores e=
very morning and afternoon, so at least that element of the trip is not los=
t!

Maryanne left me a message on Thursday night that an e-mail with an itinera=
ry and chaperone guidelines is on its way.  As of this morning, I have not =
received this e-mail.  Hopefully it will be here before Monday afternoon.

The following children struggle with bed wetting and need to be handled wit=
h much sensitivity around the matter:

Gregory Lee (parents providing sleeping bag liners that can be changed out)=
.
Ethan Parker
Adonis Baez
Santiago Steinman

We must do our best to protect their privacy and speak with them about this=
 ("Is your sleeping bag wet?") not within earshot of the other children.

I know of no girls that wet the bed at this point.  Do you?

Also, I think it best to have less tents with larger capacities than lots o=
f little tents that only accommodate a few children.  My husband just got a=
 six person tent that we can add to the mix.  I got the impression from Mar=
yanne that we should consolidate, if possible.  I am happy to take on four =
or five girls in my tent.

I can meet with all of you after school on Monday from 3:35 to 4:35 at a TB=
A location on campus (my room is used for aftercare).  We can just gather a=
t the office and then head over to an empty classroom.

Thank you and have a great weekend!

Warmly,



Mary Spurgin I Third Grade Teacher
