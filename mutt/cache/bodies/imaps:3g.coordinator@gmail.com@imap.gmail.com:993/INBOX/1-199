I've already inserted one into his sleeping bag (and had him try it =
out), and have left it there so it's ready to sleep in.  It doesn't =
fasten to the sleeping bag, but rather is just inserted.  One side is =
the bottom that goes underneath him and the other, thinner side is the =
top.  I will include a plastic bag to put one into in the event of =
bedwetting.  There will also be extra set of PJs and underwear for him.
