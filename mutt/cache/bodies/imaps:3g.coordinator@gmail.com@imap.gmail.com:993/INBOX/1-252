Sounds good, thank you for uploading the photos! I'm sorry my DSL made it
impossible for me to do so :(

 

As for reimbursement, all of the receipts I submitted are accurate. Of
course, please let me know if anyone has any questions. 

 

Thanks, Scott. Talk to you soon! Corey

Hi Corey,
Sorry for not replying sooner. Regarding reimbursement, just do what you
think is reasonable. My previous request must be weighed against the things
I'm ignorant of, such as food being stored for Pioneer.

Regarding your last suggestion about everyone brings their own meal, I'm
leaning pretty heavily that way too.

It'll be nice to bounce ideas off of each other.

BTW, your photo disc is in our inbox. Everyone should now have access to all
the photos online.

Hi all, 

 

... Contributing some additional ideas for Pioneer & beyond:

 

We are never going to be able to use 100% of what we buy for trips; some
perishables are just going to need to be eaten. If the school is paying for
these foods in the future, I think we should donate all leftovers to the
school for use in aftercare, early childhood, teacher lunches, etc. But I
don't think we should ask parents to "buy" them back, unless they really
want to (on one of Zoe's trips there was a lot of leftover items that our
family used regularly and so this is exactly what we did). Buying back is
too confusing, too time consuming, etc. 

 

 

Perhaps not a popular idea but maybe one to consider: In the future, to save
money, time, stress, etc. one real option would be to just have parents send
in all meals, snacks, etc for their own child. Only food that doesn't need
heating (i.e. breakfast couldn't be eggs or oatmeal). Even if we're doing
hot dogs over the fire or whatever, parents can send their kids with their
own. No shopping, no preparing, no receipt submissions and reimbursements.
All we'd need are a bunch of ice chests and ice.

 

Just a thought :)

 

Corey

Scott,

 

We had a lot of extra food that Corey bought that she gave out to people
when we got back.  I think she should just submit her whole shopping bill to
school because that is too much to figure out.

> This trip is relatively new for our school, and it is evident that we have
not yet mastered the details of this overnight. Having asked parents to
purchase food for this trip was clearly a departure from our current
practices to fund field trips entirely out of tuition, as we do state
clearly in our tuition contract that parents will not incur any additional
charges other than those related to our strings program. For a variety of
reasons, we did not include the cost for the food expense associated with
this field trip in the class budget, which led to parents being asked to
provide funding for the food. In retrospect, this should have been handled
differently, and I'm so very sorry for any confusion or financial strain
this may have caused you and the Grade 3 class parents.

> 

> In this light, we feel it is the responsibility of the school to reimburse
parents fully for the unplanned expenses they incurred related to food for
this trip. This additional expense does not mean that the budget of the
class will be reduced, but simply means that the funds will be located
elsewhere. Parents are of course very welcome to make a tax deductible
donation to the school if they would like to donate the amount they spent on
the trip. They can simply add that amount to the annual fund contribution
they were already planning on donating. If the class parents who made the
purchases wish to be reimbursed, they will simply need to fill out a
reimbursement form, with the receipts attached, and submit it to the office.

carrying the Grade 3 class.

asked to provide funding for the food. In retrospect, this should have =
been handled differently, and I'm so very sorry for any confusion or =
financial strain this may have caused you and the Grade 3 class =
parents.<o:p></o:p></p><p>&gt; <o:p></o:p></p><p>&gt; In this light, we =
feel it is the responsibility of the school to reimburse parents fully =
for the unplanned expenses they incurred related to food for this trip. =
This additional expense does not mean that the budget of the class will =
be reduced, but simply means that the funds will be located elsewhere. =
Parents are of course very welcome to make a tax deductible donation to =
the school if they would like to donate the amount they spent on the =
trip. They can simply add that amount to the annual fund contribution =
they were already planning on donating. If the class parents who made =
the purchases wish to be reimbursed, they will simply need to fill out a =
reimbursement form, with the receipts attached, and submit it to the =
office.<o:p></o:p></p><p>&gt; <o:p></o:p></p><p>&gt; I hope this helps =
clarify, but please let me know if you have additional questions. Again, =
I apologize for any confusion that has surrounded the organization of =
this particular trip and am grateful to be able to benefit from your =
experience this year to ensure a smoother process for classes to come. =
Thank you for your support of the school on many levels, and for =
carrying the Grade 3 class.<o:p></o:p></p><p>&gt; <o:p></o:p></p><p>&gt; =
