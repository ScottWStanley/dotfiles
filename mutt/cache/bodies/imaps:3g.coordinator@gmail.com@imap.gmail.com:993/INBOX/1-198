I've slightly changed the extra PJs scenario.  Since Gregory doesn't =
normally like PJs (too confining and too warm, I think), I've put one =
pair of PJs in for him and told him if he wets, he can put on sweatpants =
and any t-shirt and underwear, besides these will be looser, easier and =
faster to put on in the middle of the night.

There is a plastic bag in with the sleeping bag for a wet sleeping bag =
insert, and there are a couple of plastic bags in with the clothes in =
case of wet sleeping clothes.

He'll definitely need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night =
(11:30/12:00), as he's been wetting the bed lately; it may be he's =
worried about the trip and isn't saying so.  Maybe bring some medical =
gloves so you don't have to deal with touching the wet stuff??  I'm =
sorry!!  And we really appreciate your help!=20

His eyeglass case is in a gallon Ziploc bag in duffle for his clothes.

Thank you,

Lydia
