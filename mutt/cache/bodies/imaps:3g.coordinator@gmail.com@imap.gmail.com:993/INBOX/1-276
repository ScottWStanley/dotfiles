Hi Mary,=0A=
I hope your Sunday is going well :)=0A=
=0A=
I'm going to send the email below to the office, but would like you to revi=
ew it to make sure I don't say anything out of line (ultimately being YOUR =
representative to the class).=0A=
=0A=
Please feel free to make any edits you think should happen and send back to=
 me.=0A=

Dear Third Grade Parents,=0A=
Thank you to those who have dropped off your checks. We've repaid two of th=
e three parents, and partially paid the third.=0A=
=0A=
We need 6 more checks; it would be great if we could get these by the end o=
f this week. Please do what you can to make this happen.=0A=
=0A=
At this time I'd also like to acknowledge that it's not typical for there t=
o be a "charge" associated with field trips at Three Cedars. It would have =
been much better for the class to come together as a community to contribut=
e materials or time, rather than a few people making decisions for the whol=
e class and then shouldering that load. However, outside issues made planni=
ng very difficult to achieve this kind of coordination.=0A=
=0A=
The planning for the May trip to Pioneer Farm will be much more gratifying =
for ALL parents, and you will not be asked for any payment. I've got a pret=
ty thick skin, so you're all certainly welcome to give any feedback you hav=
e to make Pioneer more enjoyable for you.=0A=
