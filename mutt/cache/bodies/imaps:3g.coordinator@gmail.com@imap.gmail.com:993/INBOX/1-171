Subject: Farm Trip updates for chaperones

Dear Chaperones=2C

Thank you for all of your hard work and time!

I hope by now that you have seen my letter about the farm trip.  As of now=
=2C I have spoken with Lydia and Mary.  Mary is coming as a chaperone. We a=
re way over the limit=2C but Maryanne says as long as the extra adults are =
not involved in the activities (but maybe involved in cooking and other thi=
ngs instead)=2C then the adult crowding will not be an issue.

Unfortunately=2C Joseph Mantis will not join us on the trip because he is i=
n his aunt's wedding.  However=2C Joseph lives on a farm and does farm chor=
es every morning and afternoon=2C so at least that element of the trip is n=
ot lost!

Maryanne left me a message on Thursday night that an e-mail with an itinera=
ry and chaperone guidelines is on its way.  As of this morning=2C I have no=
t received this e-mail.  Hopefully it will be here before Monday afternoon.

The following children struggle with bed wetting and need to be handled wit=
h much sensitivity around the matter:

Gregory Lee (parents providing sleeping bag liners that can be changed out)=
.
Ethan Parker
Adonis Baez
Santiago Steinman

We must do our best to protect their privacy and speak with them about this=
 ("Is your sleeping bag wet?") not within earshot of the other children.

I know of no girls that wet the bed at this point.  Do you?

Also=2C I think it best to have less tents with larger capacities than lots=
 of little tents that only accommodate a few children.  My husband just got=
 a six person tent that we can add to the mix.  I got the impression from M=
aryanne that we should consolidate=2C if possible.  I am happy to take on f=
our or five girls in my tent.

I can meet with all of you after school on Monday from 3:35 to 4:35 at a TB=
A location on campus (my room is used for aftercare).  We can just gather a=
t the office and then head over to an empty classroom.

Thank you and have a great weekend!

Warmly=2C
