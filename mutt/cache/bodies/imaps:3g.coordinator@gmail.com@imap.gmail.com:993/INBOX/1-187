Hello all,

Originally I planned to bring firewood for sharing on Saturday.  Now I see
there is a fire on Sunday morning?  If so we will need to get more people
to bring wood.  I am bringing two bundles of wood and one of kindling.
Rheanne is bringing two bundles worth.

I can bring a few bowls for cooking and a couple of spatulas.  We still
need another pan or two for cooking eggs.  I have one cast iron skillet
that has had bacon cooked in it many times that I can bring.  I have one
small tea kettle to boil water and one small aluminum cooking pot to boil
water in, if we need more than this, then?  I can bring a couple of serving
spoons, how many do we need?  I have 4 serrated knives for veggie
chopping.  I now have 3 to 4 small cutting boards.  I can bring two or
three metal and one plastic bowl for scrambling eggs or putting veggies
in.  Anything else?

I cant take on looking for all of this stuff if one of you can.  I am
either subbing in Apple Blossom in the morning or taking Eva to the doctor
because she thinks she may have sprained or broke her foot while playing in
Trillium Hall during our meeting.  Then Wednesday will be shopping and
packing and getting to school twice.

Good meeting today, lots of good info.

Thank you all for making this happen, these are beautiful children we have,

Rachel
