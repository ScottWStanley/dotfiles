Third Grade Parents=2C



Following are a few more items to consider regarding our trip to Sunfield.

Prompt Departure

Please arrive at the TCWS parking lot no later than 7:00am. WSDOT has been =
notified of our trip on Thursday=2C and=2C per standard procedure=2C will h=
ave ensured a sufficient number of life-jackets will be available for our p=
articular ferry (07:55). While we'll be able to catch the next ferry should=
 we miss this one=2C I can't be sure what provisions will exist for our gro=
up.



Additionally=2C the first activity at Sunfield will begin promptly at 10:00=
am=2C and it would be disruptive to the other schools for us to arrive in t=
he middle of it.



Sanae and I will be in the parking lot at 06:45=3B anyone who is willing to=
 show up earlier than 7am is more than welcome to=2C and the extra effort w=
ill be appreciated :)



Funding

While the school had originally intended to fund the cost of our food=2C th=
is has changed and we will be responsible for this cost. After we return fr=
om the trip=2C all costs will be tallied and divided amongst each family. W=
ith this in mind=2C food selection has been made with a keen focus on cost.=
 We appreciate your understanding on this matter.



Kudos

Finally=2C I'd like to let you all know that Lisa and Kelly Anderson and Co=
rey Colwell-Lipson worked very hard over the weekend shopping and preparing=
 food for the trip=2C so please thank them for their effort when you see th=
em.



We hope your children are excited about the trip=3B we chaperones will be d=
oing our part to ensure this is a rewarding experience for them.



Scott and Sanae Stanley
