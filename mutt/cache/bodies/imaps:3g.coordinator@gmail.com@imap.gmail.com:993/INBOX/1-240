Hi Scott and Sanae,

Thank you. Please let me know if you need anything else from me at this tim=
e.
I appreciate you helping to urge parents to be mindful about what they clai=
m for reimbursement.

On another note, I'm trying to get a sense of how many pumpkins we will nee=
d to have available for families for the pumpkin carving party tomorrow. Ca=
n you tell me if you will be bringing your own or looking to pick some up h=
ere?

Thanks!
Seraphina

Hi again Seraphina.=20
Sanae told me that in her email yesterday she left you with an action, but =
there is no action required at this time. Please consider her email as refe=
rence information only.

Our current plan is still to forward your email from yesterday to the paren=
ts to be reimbursed, but I will be urging them to consider CAREFULLY what t=
o claim.

As usual, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the work party.

-Scott
