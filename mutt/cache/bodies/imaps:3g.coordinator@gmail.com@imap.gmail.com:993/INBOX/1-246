Scott,

I can't remember what I submitted now.  Was my only food expense water?  If s=
o I won't worry about it.

This whole thing is illogical.  We aren't supposed to have to pay extra out o=
f pocket, but the parents who drove and worked have to pay out of pocket?  I=
t's water under the bridge now, but it is not logical.

Thank you,

Rachel
