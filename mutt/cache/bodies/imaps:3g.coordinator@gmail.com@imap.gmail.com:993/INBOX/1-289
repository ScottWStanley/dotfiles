Hi Sanae -  Sure! We're very open on start time. I'll pack Finn a lunch and
snack? Thanks so much. My apologies again on the delay in getting back. Hope
Hannah has a great show tonight! Warmly, Corey

Hi Corey,

I wish Scott asked me first

11am will be better for all of us, don't you think?

Hi Corey,
You can bring Finley as early as 10am, and she can stay however long works
for you (2pm in this case).

Hi! Sorry for the delay... Just waaaaaay too much going on trying to catch
up from my trip, I'm really behind. Thanks for your understanding.

Ok, so I have to have Finn in Fall City at 3pm, would like to pick her up
from you no later than 2, but could be earlier anytime. What time would feel
right for your family/Nikka? We're really open.

Thanks for letting me know! Hope you are all well...

Corey

Hi Corey,
Welcome back. Sunday at our place sounds great; I'll leave the time up to
you. Stop in for tea if you'd like.

Our condo:
8017 145th Av. NE
Redmond, WA 98052

The development is called Cedar Ridge, and it's on the north side of Redmond
Way, about 500 feet west of 148th Av.
Once you turn into the complex, go straight (as opposed to taking the
immediate right); we're in the second building on the left, on the second
floor.

I'm glad to hear that about Finley; when Nikka opens up a bit more I bet the
two of them could become good friends.

-Scott
