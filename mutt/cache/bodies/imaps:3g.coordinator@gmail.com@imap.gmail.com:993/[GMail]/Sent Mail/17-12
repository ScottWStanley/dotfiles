Comrades,
Well, we pulled it off and had a lot of fun. It was a real gift to be able to work with you all. I feel like we've set a strong foundation to build a really strong class bond.

Let's discuss how we can make our next trip even better, and how we can improve the quality of the Sunfield experience for following Third Graders.

It would be great to get together after school one day this week, while memories are still fresh. If you just don't have the time or feel you have nothing you'd like to contribute, that's fine too (many of you must be tired, and you've already done so much), but it's REALLY appreciated if you can make it. 

Please reply-all and indicate your availability this week. Keep in mingd there's a Parent Night this Tuesday. I wonder if it's easier to get together right before that.

For myself; I'm completely flexible, so I'll await your responses.

-Scott
